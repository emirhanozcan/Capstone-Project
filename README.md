# Capstone-Project
In this project, I analyzed demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany, comparing it against demographics information for the general population. I used unsupervised learning techniques to perform customer segmentation, identifying the parts of the population that best describe the core customer base of the company. Then, I used supervised machine learning techniques to predict which individuals are most likely to convert into becoming customers for the company.
