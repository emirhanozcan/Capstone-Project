# Capstone-Project
In this project, the demographics data from Arvato was analyzed and compared against demographics information for the general population. The unsuperived machine learning algorithms were applied to perform customer segmentation,to find out the core customer base of the company. Then, I supervised machine learning algorithms were applied in order to predict which individuals are most likely to become a future potential customer for the company.

## Project Motivation
Applying and practicing the information I learned during the Udacity Nanodegree program in order to improve my skills on machine learning.
